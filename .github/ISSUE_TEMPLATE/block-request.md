**Block names**
Name of this block and its variants. This is exactly how they will appear in game!
Examples:
Dirt, Dirt Slab, Dirt Stairs, etc.

**Textures**
Attach all textures you have already made for this block set. If you haven't made any, that's fine too! However, this
will probably take much longer to be implemented if you haven't. There are no guarantees that your textures will
actually get used if the blocks are added, though

**Additional info**
Should this block do something special? Have any other info? Put it here!
