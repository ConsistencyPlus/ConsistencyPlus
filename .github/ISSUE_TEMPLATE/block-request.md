**Block name(s) and description**

Tell us the name of the block(s) you are requesting.  For a singular block, you could just put the name of the block (and any shapes it has, such as slabs, stairs, etc).  For a set, tell us the material it would be made out of.
Example (singular block): "Carved Melons"
Example (block set): "Block set for Glass"

If needed, give us a description of the block you are requesting.  This can include things such as recipes, any functions it may have outside a building block, etc.

**Textures**

If you've made any, replace this section with images of potential textures, or images of existing blocks (whether from C+ or not) that it should look similar to.  If we have a general idea of what the block will look like, we may be more likely to add it!  Generally, you should include at least one image for blocks completely foreign to C+ and its existing block sets

**Additional info**

Should this block do something special that isn't mentioned in the description? Have any other info we should know regarding your suggestion? Put it here!
