**Block names**
Name of this block and it's variants. This is exactly how they will appear in game!
Examples:
Dirt
Dirt Slab
Dirt Stairs
etc.

**Textures**
Attach all textures you have already made for this block set. If you haven't made any, that's fine too! However, this will probably take much longer to be implemented. 
No guarantees that your textures actually get used if the blocks are added. 

**Additional info**
Should this block do something special? Have any other info? Put it here!
