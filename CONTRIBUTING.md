## Let's get this out of the way

Contributing, for the purposes of this, can include a lot of things. So that's what this page is here for. If you want
to directly help, we highly recommend getting into contact with Carter ( `Cart3r#7285` ) or Siuol ( `"Siuol"
Appeared#5729` ) on Discord. Alternatively, you can join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/VeNX7h8bAK.

### Code Contributors

You guys know the drill. Currently, we don't have a Maven or the like, if you are interested, you can fork this project
via Git. From there, you can send in pull requests.

### Artist / Datapack devs

If you are an artist and have a little coding experience, we recommend you register any new blocks that you need to add,
and then add them from there. If you can't do that, Consistency+ uses an internal resource/datapack found at
`src/main/resources`. This also applies if you wish to fix a bug with any data thing.

### Modpack Devs

If you have a modpack, feel free to add this mod! We would prefer you give credit to us, though. In the future, we may
release some datapacks, so that way it's easier to support other mods like Blockus that add the same stuff as us.

### Content Creators

If you make content or stream or the alike, we encourage featuring our mod in a stream or showcase! It really helps
bring attention. (PS: If you want, I (Siuol) would be more than happy to be a guest!)

### Average Player

As for everyone else, just get the word out! Telling more people bout us helps us!
