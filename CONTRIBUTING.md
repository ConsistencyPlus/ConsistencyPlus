## What ways can I contribute? 

Contributing, for the purposes of this, can include a lot of things. So that's what this page is here for. 

Our team has many different roles, such as developers, translators, artists, and other general contributors.
The best way to get into contact with us is to talk to us on Discord.  You can either message us directly (Carter - `Cart3r#7285` and/or Siuol - `"Siuol" Appeared#5729` ), or you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VeNX7h8bAK).

Of course, any contributions will be credited.  We still have a few names to add before our credits are up to date, but anyone who has made contributions will be included.

### Code Contributors/Developers

In our discord server we have two main development roles - Code Contributor and Project Developer.  Code Contributor is for those who have contributed only a feature or set of features, while Project Developer is for those who wish to continue working with us as we continue to update the project.

We also have a role for notable developers in the modding community who haven't worked on Consistency+ but are in our server. 

### Texture Artists

While we already have a decent number of people doing the textures for Consistency+, if you wish to contribute assets then feel free to share them with us.  If you have textures for blocks we have planned but not added yet, or improvements to textures already in the mod, they may be added in our next update if our team likes them and they fit in with our other assets.

### Translators

We are in need of people willing to help us translate.  We currently support a small number of non-English languages (If I' not mistaken, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian as of writing this), and are looking to include more as we release updates.  If you speak a language that we have not included a translation for yet, we would love your help!

### You, the User

Even if you yourself have not contributed directly to the development of our mod, we'd like to thank you for using it, or at least reading this document.  Even by just using or telling people about Consistency+ you are helping our project grow, and again, thank you for that!
