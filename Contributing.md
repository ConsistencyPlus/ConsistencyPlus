## Lets get this out of the way.

Contributing, for the purposes of this, can include alot of things. So thats what this page is here for. Furthermore, if
you want to directly help, we highly recommend getting into contact with Carter ( Cart3r#7285 ) or Siuol ( "Siuol"
Appeared#5729 ) on Discord. Alternatively, you can join our discord at discord.gg/sc835yTy3q

### Code Contributors

You guys know the drill. Currently, we dont have a Maven or the alike, so instead if you are interested you can take
care of it via forking our project through Git. From there, you can try sending pull requests with your new features and
the alike!

### Artist / Datapack devs

If you are an artist and have a little coding expirience, we recommend you register any new blocks that you need to add,
and then add them from there. If you cant do that, Consistency+ uses an internal resource/datapack found at
master/src/main/resources. This also applies if you wish to fix a bug with any data thing.

### Modpack Devs

If you have a modpack, feel free to add this mod! You should probably give credit to us though. In the future, we may
release some datapacks and the alike so that way its easier to support other mods like Blockus that add the same stuff
as us.

### Content Creators

If you make content or stream or the alike, we incourage featuring our mod in a stream or showcase! It really helps
bring attention. (PS: If you want, I (Siuol) would be more than happy to be a guest!)

### Average Player

As for everyone else, just get the word out! Telling more people bout us helps us!
