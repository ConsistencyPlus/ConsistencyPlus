## Lets get this out of the way.
Contributing, for the purposes of this, can include alot of things. So thats what this page is here for.
Furthermore, if you want to directly help, we highly recommend getting into contact with Carter ( Cart3r#7285 ) or Siuol ( "Siuol" Appeared#5729 ) on Discord. Alternatively, you can join our discord at discord.gg/sc835yTy3q

### Code Contributors
You guys know the drill.
Currently, we dont have a Maven or the alike, so instead if you are interested you can take care of it via forking our project through Git. From there, you can try sending pull requests with your new features and the alike!

### Artist / Datapack devs
If you are an artist and have a little coding expirience, we recommend you register any new blocks that you need to add, and then add them from there.
If you cant do that, Consistency+ uses an internal resource/datapack found at master/src/main/resources. This also applies if you wish to fix a bug with any data thing.

### Modpack Devs
If you have a modpack, feel free to add this mod! You should probably give credit to us though. In the future, we may release some datapacks and the alike so that way its easier to support other mods like Blockus that add the same stuff as us.

### Content Creators
If you make content or stream or the alike, we incourage featuring our mod in a stream or showcase! It really helps bring attention. (PS: If you want, I (Siuol) would be more than happy to be a guest!)

### Average Player
As for everyone else, just get the word out! Telling more people bout us helps us!
