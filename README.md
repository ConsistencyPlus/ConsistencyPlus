# Consistency+

Consistency+ is a Minecraft mod for 1.16.4+ Fabric and Quilt Mod Loader about making a consistent block list.

## What's added?

Anything that's inconsistent block-wise in the game. Such as there being purpur pillars, but no stone brick pillars. Or
there being cobblestone walls, but no quartz walls. These issues and many, many more are fixed in this mod!

NOTE: We went a little overkill with the brainstorming for this mod. Many of the variants we plan on adding are not
things that we seriously would expect Mojang to consider adding, but rather just extra blocks for the builders out
there. While a lot of the variants we plan on adding are things that really should be in vanilla, most are not.

## FAQ

### How much has been added?

As of 0.3.0, we currently have Regular, Polished, Cut, Smooth, and Bricks for all stones (i.e. stone, end stone,
blackstone, purpur, etc.) type blocks, each of those have Slabs, Stairs, Walls, Gates, and regular block types.
Furthermore, we have more categories for blocks.

### How do you guys add so much? Do you guys use something like Artifice or ARRP for resource/datagen?

First off, we generate our resource and data json files using a generator by a team member named DeviousLRD. This allows
us to make them perfectly to the way we want. Though, we may be a little stubborn... some older `jsons` were made by
hand.

### When is it going to be finished?

Eventually, we hope.

### How do I contribute?

If you want to contribute, check out our contributing guide located at CONTRIBUTING.md. Contribution counts as a wide
range of things; not just code contributions!

### Could you guys add [Thing]?

Well, if you're interested, you can put it as a suggestion in the issue tracker, or even code it in yourself!

### How many blocks are you going to add?

Too many blocks

### Will the blocks have CTM (Connected Texture Mapping) support?

We currently do not have CTM support for our blocks. In the future, there may be semi-official OptiFine CTM or another
CTM format support. For now, though, it's not in our mod.

### Will you be making a Forge/Bedrock/<1.14 port?

We'll see, but for now, take it into your own hands if you want it on a specific platform

### Can **I** make a port?

We'd prefer if you asked us about it first, however, the license allows for it.

### Can we get an ETA on anything?

Our ETA is when we feel like it.

### Does Consistency+ work with other mods block lists?

Not really; Consistency+ is more a manually-adding-blocks sorta mod. Currently, we only support vanilla. In the future,
we may add support through a potential add-on system. As for conflicting recipes, if you make a modpack, you can use
datapacks to override ours; otherwise, for now, just use Polymorph to use both recipes.

### Why did you guys add [Block X] when [Mod Y] does the same thing?

We look at our mod more in a bubble. As such, we may add features that overlap, but it's not important to us.

### Is there Quilt support?

Yes. When Quilt fully releases, Consistency+ should be supported. In fact, Consistency+ was one of the first content
mods tested on the Quilt Production Beta. Regardless, Consistency+ requires Fabric API as of now.

### Why does Siuol put weird commit names

He does it as it's kinda like an inside joke to him.
