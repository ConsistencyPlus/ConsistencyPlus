# Consistency+

Consistency+ is a Minecraft mod for 1.16.4+ Fabric Mod Loader about making a consistent block list. 


## What's added?

  Anything that's inconsistent block wise in the game. Such as there being purpur pillars but no stone brick pillars. Or there being cobblestone walls but no quartz walls. These issues and many, many more are fixed in this mod!

  NOTE: We went a little overkill with the brainstorming for this mod.  Many of the variants we plan on adding are not things that we seriously would expect mojang to consider adding, but moreso as extra blocks for the builders out there.  While a lot of the variants we plan on adding are things that really should be in vanilla, most are not.

## FAQ

### How much has been added?
As of 0.3.0, we currently have Regular, Polished, Cut, Smooth, and Bricks for all of the stones (Stone, Endstone, Blackstone, Purpur, ETC.) type blocks, each of those have Slabs, Stairs, Walls, Gates, and regular block types. Furthermore, we have more categories for blocks.

### How do you guys add so much? Do you guys use something like Artifice or ARRP for resource/datagen?
First off, we generate our resource and data json files using a generator by a team member named DeviousLRD. This allows us to make them perfectly to the way we want. Though, we may be a little stubborn... Also, some of the older Jsons were made by hand.

### When is it going to be finished?
Eventually, we hope.

### How do I contribute?
If you want to contribute, check out our contributing guide located at the file contributing.md . Furthermore, Contribution counts as a wide range of things!

### Could you guys add [Thing]?
Well, if you're interested, you can put it as a suggestion in the issue tracker, or even code it in yourself!

### How many blocks are you going to add?
Too many blocks

### Will the blocks have CTM (Connected Texture Mapping) support?
We currently do not have CTM support for our blocks. In the future, there may be semi-official Optifine CTM or another CTM format support. But for now, its not on our mod.

### Will you be making a Forge/Bedrock/<1.14 port?
Currently, we do not have plans for any of those ports. We MAY have some post 1.0.0, but for now, its not going to be added.

### Can **I** make a port?
We'd prefer if you asked us about it first, however the license allows for it. 

### Can we get an ETA
No.

### Does Consistency+ work with other mods block lists?
Not really, Consistency+ is more a manually adding blocks sorta mod. And currently it only supports vanilla. In the future, we may add support through a potential addon system.
As for conflicting recipes, if you make a modpack you can use datapacks to override ours, otherwise just use Polymorph to use both recipes.

### Why did you guys add [Block X] when [Mod Y] does the same thing?
We look at our mod more in a bubble. As such, we may add features that overlap, but its not important to us.

### Why does Siuol put weird commit names
He does it as its kinda like an inside joke to him.
