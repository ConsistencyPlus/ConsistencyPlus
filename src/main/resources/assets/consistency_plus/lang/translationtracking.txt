Translator Comments:

Siuol - Alright, I would like to point out the following.
1. I do not actually know any other languages besides English, though I would like to learn them.
2. I'm not dumb enough to use Google Translate. I prefer scuffed lang files.
3. I'll probably do initial translations, with occasional updates every couple hundred blocks or so.
If you actually can translate, DM me on Discord at `"Siuol" Appeared#5729` and we can work something out.

MobButcher - To translate language files from English to Russian I've created a script that allows me to automatically parse the strings and apply proper grammar to them.
Though it's janky, I can fairly easily update my translations. Feel free to contact me for details, contact info available on GitHub profile.

MobButcher - Reworked my translation stript, now it gives more pleasing and logical translation structures.
Also found a couple of mistakes in Russian translation that I've quickly fixed.
