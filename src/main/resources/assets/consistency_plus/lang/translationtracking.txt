Translator Comments:

Siuol - Alright, I would like to point out the following.
1. I do not actually know any other languages besides English, though I would like to learn them.
2. Im not dumb enough to use google translate. I prefer scuffed lang files.
3. Ill probably do initial translations, with occasional updates every couple hundred blocks or so.  ``
IF you actually can translate DM me on discord at "Siuol" Appeared#5729 and we can work something out.
