Translator Comments:

Siuol - Alright, I would like to point out the following.
1. I do not actually know any other languages besides English, though I would like to learn them.
2. I'm not dumb enough to use Google Translate. I prefer scuffed lang files.
3. I'll probably do initial translations, with occasional updates every couple hundred blocks or so.
If you actually can translate, DM me on Discord at `"Siuol" Appeared#5729` and we can work something out.
