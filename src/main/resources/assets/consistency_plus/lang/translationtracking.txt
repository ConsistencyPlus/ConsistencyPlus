Translator Comments:

Siuol - Alright, I would like to point out the following.
1. I do not actually know any other languages besides English, though I would like to learn them.
2. Im not dumb enough to use google translate. I perfer scuffed lang files.
3. Ill probably do inital translations, with occasional updates every couple hundred blocks or so.  ``
