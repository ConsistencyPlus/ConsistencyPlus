To use this, you'll need a plugin that lets you change mass filenames.  
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17063-regex-rename-files/versions

STEP 1:   Copy "blank" (the folder inside "blank_guide") and rename it to the block of your choosing.
STEP 1.5: Install the plugin if you haven't already
STEP 2:   Go through every folder using the plugin and replace the word "blank" with the block of your choosing.  This will change the filenames.
STEP 3:   For changing the actual contents of the files, use intellij's built in refactor options to search for uses of "blank" and "Blank"*
STEP 4:   Copy the contents of the new folders into the actual source.

*"Blank" with a capital B is used in the lang file.
