  rules:
    Follow Discord's rules: "Both the [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)."
    Don't be an asshole: This includes attacking others or starting unwanted debates for most any reason.
    Don't spam: "[You're not a member of Monty Python.](https://youtu.be/_bW4vEo1F4E)"
    No offensive/questionable content: This is for a Minecraft mod, we don't need any of that kind of stuff here.
    Leave drama outside this server: There are whole servers for that, and this isn't one of them.
